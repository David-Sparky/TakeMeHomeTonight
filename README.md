#TakeMeHomeTonight
Project for RPI ITWS-4500 Web Science Systems Development

#Goal
To provide a way for students to find rides to and from school easily, even if they donâ€™t have a car or know someone who has one.

#Our Audience
Our audience is students, faculty and staff within the RPI community. The website can be used by those that have cars on campus and those who do not. Eventually, Take Me Home Tonight would like to branch out to other campuses.
